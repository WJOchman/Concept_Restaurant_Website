# Concept_Restaurant_Website

I do not own this website, this is tutorial which I have followed to practice my HTML and CSS knowledge on a more "real-world" example.

This is another practice project for me to create a "real-world" project which will reinforce the studying which was done for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
